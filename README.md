Bester Kata
-----------
Create a 'Bester' class that can order objects based on how awesome they are: cookies are better if they have more 
chocolate chips, and rectangles are better if they have a larger area. Add in a Game class- games with higher scores are 
better than games with lower scores. Make sure Bester can work generally for all three class types. Don't forget to add 
tests!
